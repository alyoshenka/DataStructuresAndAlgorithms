# Week 2 - Stacks and Queues

## Stacks

LIFO

useful for reversing items in a collection without knowing total count

Common use cases:
- browser history
- mobile application screens
- evaluating arithmetic expressions

## Queues

FIFO

operations happen at both ends

Deque: double-ended queue -> items can be added/removed from either end

Priority queue -> orders items by importance
